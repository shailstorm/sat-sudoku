it is hosted on render: https://sudoku-3h4d.onrender.com/ but runs really slowly cuz they slow down requests for inactivity. <br />

so i suggest either

**hosting it locally:**
1. clone this repo
2. $ pip install requirements.txt
3. $ python3 server.py
4. navigate to browser

OR (_if you're on a mac_)...

**downloading the desktop app file:** <br />
[sudoku.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21807907/sudoku.zip) <br />
you can unzip and drag sudoku.app into your Applications folder to play sudoku offline whenever :)
